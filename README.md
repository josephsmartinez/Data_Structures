# Data_Structures

<strong>From my COP3530 class 2018 Summer C</strong>
<p>
Summary Description:
Basic concepts of data organization, the running time of a program, abstract types, data structures including linked lists, n-ary trees, sets and graphs, internal sorting.
Prerequisites:
Every student is expected to have received a C or better grade in the two pre-requisites for this course: Discrete Mathematics (MAD-2104) or Discrete Structures (COT-3100 or COT-3993), and Programming II (COP-3337). I strongly suggest anyone not satisfying these conditions to drop the course.
If your COP-3337 prerequisite is dated from prior to Summer 2012, you may well have forgotten everything you learned. You should seriously consider reviewing that material.
Text Book:
Required text: “Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java” by Mark Allen Weiss, 3rd Edition, ISBN-13: 978-0132576277, ISBN-10: 0132576279. More Information
Programming Language:
 This course will be conducted in Java. You must use a Java 7 or higher. (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
Eclipse is recommended programming environment.
Course Outcomes:
Be familiar with basic techniques of algorithm analysis. 
Be familiar with writing recursive methods. 
Master the implementation of linked data structures such as linked lists and binary trees. 
Be familiar with advanced data structures such as balanced search trees, hash tables, priority queues and the disjoint set union/find data structure. 
Be familiar with several sub-quadratic sorting algorithms including Quicksort, Mergesort and Heapsort. Sorting in linear time.
Be familiar with some graph algorithms such as topological sort, shortest path and minimum spanning tree.
Master the standard data structure library of a major programming language (e.g. java.util).
Master analyzing problems and writing program solutions to problems using the above techniques and data structures.
